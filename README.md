# PRODIGY_DS_04
This task focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. Using a dataset of tweets, we explore the distribution of sentiments across different categories and visualize the data to gain insights into public sentiment. The task involves data cleaning, preprocessing, sentiment classification, and visualization techniques.

Steps
1. Data Loading: Load the training and validation datasets.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distribution of sentiments and visualize the data.
4. Model Training: Train a sentiment classification model using machine learning algorithms.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using the validation dataset.
6. Visualization: Create visualizations to represent sentiment patterns across different categories.
